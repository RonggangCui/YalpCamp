## üåü Introduction

**Yelp Camp** is a modern web application where outdoor enthusiasts can discover, share, and review campgrounds. Whether you're planning your next adventure or just browsing for inspiration, our platform offers a user-friendly interface and extensive features to make your experience seamless.

üöÄ Developed a campground review application featuring user authentication, CRUD API endpoints for campground review management with Express.js and MongoDB. The dynamic UI, built with EJS and Bootstrap, ensures an intuitive and responsive user experience. Robust front-end and back-end data validation, integrated image upload functionality, and Google Maps APIs for location services make this application reliable and user-friendly. The app is deployed using a 3-tier architecture: S3 for asset storage, MongoDB Atlas for database management, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting, ensuring scalability and performance.

## üèóÔ∏è App Structure

The application is meticulously organized into various directories and files to ensure clarity and maintainability:

- **`.ebextensions`**: Configuration files for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, streamlining deployment.
- **`.platform`**: Custom platform hooks for specific configurations.
